# Helm Charts

The canonical source for Helm charts is the [Helm Hub](https://hub.helm.sh/), an aggregator for distributed chart repos.

This GitHub project is the source for Helm `depscloud-stable` and `depscloud-incubator` [Helm chart repositories](https://v3.helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_repository/).

For more information about installing and using Helm, see the [Helm Docs](https://helm.sh/docs/).
For a quick introduction to Charts, see the [Chart Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/).

## How do I install these charts?

```
$ helm repo add depscloud-stable https://deps-cloud.github.io/charts/stable
"depscloud-stable" has been added to your repositories
```

## How do I enable the incubator repository?

```
$ helm repo add depscloud-incubator https://deps-cloud.github.io/charts/incubator
"depscloud-incubator" has been added to your repositories
```
